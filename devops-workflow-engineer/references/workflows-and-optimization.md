# CI/CD Workflows, Strategies, and Optimization

Read this when designing a CI or CD pipeline, choosing a deployment strategy, optimizing pipeline cost/runtime, applying GitHub Actions patterns, or troubleshooting workflows.

## Workflow 1: CI Pipeline Design

The agent generates pipelines following fail-fast ordering:

1. **Lint and format** (~30s) -- cheapest gate first
2. **Unit tests** (~2-5m) -- matrix across versions
3. **Build verification** (~3-8m)
4. **Integration tests** (~5-15m, parallel with build)
5. **Security scanning** (~2-5m)

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: make lint

  test:
    needs: lint
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: { python-version: "${{ matrix.python-version }}", cache: pip }
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pytest --junitxml=results.xml

  security:
    needs: lint
    steps:
      - run: pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

**CI targets:**

| Metric | Target | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Total CI time | < 10 min | Parallelize, add caching |
| Lint step | < 1 min | Use pre-commit locally |
| Unit tests | < 5 min | Split suites, use matrix |
| Flaky rate | < 1% | Quarantine flaky tests |
| Cache hit rate | > 80% | Review cache keys |

## Workflow 2: CD Pipeline and Multi-Environment Deployment

```bash
python scripts/deployment_planner.py --type webapp --environments dev,staging,prod --format json
```

**Environment promotion flow:**
```
Build -> Dev (auto) -> Staging (auto) -> Production (manual approval)
                                              |
                                        Canary (10%) -> Full rollout
```

| Aspect | Dev | Staging | Production |
|--------|-----|---------|------------|
| Trigger | Every push | Merge to main | Manual approval |
| Replicas | 1 | 2 | 3+ (auto-scaled) |
| Secrets | Repository | Environment | Vault/OIDC |
| Monitoring | Basic logs | Full observability | Full + alerting |

**Key CD rules:**
- Build once, deploy the same artifact everywhere
- Tag artifacts with commit SHA for traceability
- Use environment protection rules for production gates
- Maintain rollback capability at every stage

## Workflow 3: Pipeline Optimization

```bash
python scripts/pipeline_analyzer.py .github/workflows/ --format json -o report.json
```

The agent checks for:

1. **Missing caching** -- dependencies reinstalled every run
2. **No timeouts** -- stuck jobs burn budget
3. **Sequential chains** that could parallelize
4. **Deprecated actions** with newer versions available
5. **Security issues** -- secrets in logs, missing permissions scoping
6. **Cost inefficiency** -- oversized runners, no path filtering

**Optimization techniques:**

**Path-based filtering** -- skip CI for docs-only changes:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths: ['src/**', 'tests/**', 'requirements*.txt']
    paths-ignore: ['docs/**', '*.md']
```

**Concurrency cancellation** -- cancel superseded runs:
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**Dependency caching:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
```

## Deployment Strategies

**Decision tree:**
```
Zero-downtime required?
  No  -> Rolling deployment
  Yes -> Need instant rollback?
    No  -> Rolling with health checks
    Yes -> Budget for 2x infrastructure?
      Yes -> Blue-green
      No  -> Canary
```

**Canary traffic split schedule:**

| Phase | % | Duration | Gate |
|-------|---|----------|------|
| 1 | 5% | 15 min | Error rate < 0.1% |
| 2 | 25% | 30 min | P99 latency < 200ms |
| 3 | 50% | 60 min | Business metrics stable |
| 4 | 100% | -- | Full promotion |

## GitHub Actions Patterns

**Reusable workflows** -- define once, call everywhere:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment: { required: true, type: string }
      image_tag: { required: true, type: string }
    secrets:
      DEPLOY_KEY: { required: true }
```

**OIDC authentication** -- no long-lived credentials:
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
steps:
  - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
    with:
      role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/github-actions
      aws-region: us-east-1
```

**Secrets hierarchy:** Organization > Repository > Environment. Never echo secrets; use `add-mask` for dynamic values. Prefer OIDC for cloud auth.

## Runner Cost Optimization

| Runner | vCPU | RAM | Cost/min | Best For |
|--------|------|-----|----------|----------|
| 2-core | 2 | 7 GB | $0.008 | Standard tasks |
| 4-core | 4 | 16 GB | $0.016 | Build-heavy |
| 8-core | 8 | 32 GB | $0.032 | Large compilations |
| 16-core | 16 | 64 GB | $0.064 | Parallel test suites |

**Monthly estimate:** `(runs/day) x (avg min/run) x 30 x (cost/min)`
Example: 50 pushes/day x 8 min x 30 = 12,000 min x $0.008 = **$96/month**.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Monolithic workflow | 45-min single workflow | Split into parallel jobs |
| No caching | Reinstall deps every run | Cache dependencies and builds |
| Secrets in logs | Leaked credentials | `add-mask`, avoid `echo` |
| No timeout | Stuck jobs burn budget | `timeout-minutes` on every job |
| Full matrix every push | 30-min matrix on every commit | Full nightly; reduced on push |
| No rollback plan | Stuck with broken deploy | Automate rollback in CD pipeline |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Workflow never triggers | Wrong `on:` config or branch name mismatch | Verify triggers match branching strategy |
| Cache miss every run | Volatile cache key (timestamp) | Use `hashFiles()` on lock files |
| Matrix fails on one OS only | Platform-specific paths or deps | Use `shell: bash`; install OS deps per matrix entry |
| Secret not available | Wrong environment scope | Ensure job declares correct `environment:` |
| Health check fails after deploy | App not started before check | Add retry loop with backoff |
| Concurrency cancels needed runs | Overly broad group key | Scope to `workflow-ref`; separate groups for deploy |
