# Incident Response Playbooks

Read this when running an incident end-to-end: severity classification, command setup, investigation, communication, post-incident review, escalation, plus anti-patterns and troubleshooting.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Classify an incident (JSON or stdin)
echo '{"description": "Database connections timing out", "affected_users": "80%", "business_impact": "high"}' \
  | python scripts/incident_classifier.py --format text

# Multi-dimensional severity scoring
python scripts/severity_classifier.py incident.json --format markdown

# Reconstruct timeline with phase detection and gap analysis
python scripts/timeline_reconstructor.py --input events.json --detect-phases --gap-analysis --format markdown

# Build structured timeline with MTTD/MTTR metrics
python scripts/incident_timeline_builder.py incident_data.json --format markdown

# Generate Post-Incident Review
python scripts/pir_generator.py --incident incident.json --rca-method fishbone --action-items --format markdown

# Generate postmortem with benchmark comparisons
python scripts/postmortem_generator.py incident_data.json --format markdown
```

## Workflow 1: Incident Response (Detection to Resolution)

**Step 1 -- Classify severity.**

```bash
python scripts/severity_classifier.py incident.json --format json
```

The agent scores across five dimensions: revenue impact (25%), user scope (25%), data/security risk (20%), service criticality (15%), blast radius (15%).

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Comms Cadence |
|----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **SEV-1** | Complete outage, data loss, security breach | 15 min | Every 15 min |
| **SEV-2** | Partial degradation, >25% users affected | 30 min | Every 30 min |
| **SEV-3** | Single feature affected, workaround available | 2 hours | At milestones |
| **SEV-4** | Cosmetic, dev/test only, no user impact | Next business day | Standard cycle |

**Validation checkpoint:** Severity classification includes confidence score and recommended escalation path.

**Step 2 -- Establish command.**

The Incident Commander:
- Assigns within 5 min (SEV-1) or 30 min (SEV-2)
- Creates war room and incident tracking ticket
- Sends initial notification using generated template
- Coordinates between technical teams and stakeholders
- Shields responders from external distractions

**Step 3 -- Investigate and mitigate.**

The agent generates targeted investigation commands based on the affected service:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n production -l app=<service>
kubectl logs -l app=<service> --tail=100
helm history <service> -n production
```

**Decision framework for SEV-1/SEV-2:**
- Bias toward action over analysis
- Prefer rollbacks to risky fixes under pressure
- Document every decision for later review
- Consult SMEs but do not block on them

**Step 4 -- Communicate.**

The agent generates three communication templates per severity:
1. **Internal notification** -- technical details, response team, war room link
2. **Executive summary** -- business impact, ETA, leadership actions required
3. **Customer communication** -- impact scope, what is being done, next update time

**Validation checkpoint:** All stakeholders notified within committed timeframes.

## Workflow 2: Post-Incident Review

**Step 1 -- Reconstruct the timeline.**

```bash
python scripts/timeline_reconstructor.py --input events.json --detect-phases --gap-analysis --format markdown
```

The agent accepts events from logs, alerts, Slack messages, and deployment systems. Each event needs a `timestamp` and `description`. Optional fields: `source`, `type`, `actor`, `severity`.

**Supported phases:** detection, declaration, escalation, investigation, mitigation, communication, resolution.

**Step 2 -- Perform root cause analysis.**

```bash
python scripts/pir_generator.py --incident incident.json --timeline timeline.json --rca-method five_whys --action-items
```

Available RCA methods:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| `five_whys` | Linear causal chains, quick analysis |
| `fishbone` | Multi-category analysis (People, Process, Technology, Environment) |
| `timeline` | Identifying missed decision points and delays |
| `bow_tie` | Barriers analysis, prevention and mitigation controls |

**Step 3 -- Generate action items.**

The agent categorizes action items as: `immediate_fix`, `process_improvement`, `monitoring_alerting`, `documentation`, `training`, `architectural`, `tooling`.

Each action item includes: title, owner, priority, deadline, success criteria, and dependencies.

**Step 4 -- Validate postmortem quality.**

```bash
python scripts/postmortem_generator.py incident_data.json --format json
```

The agent checks:
- Every contributing factor has at least one action item (coverage gap detection)
- Action items have quality scores (0-100) based on specificity
- MTTD/MTTR benchmarked against industry standards
- Missing actions suggested for uncovered themes

**Validation checkpoint:** Zero coverage gaps. All P0 action items have owners and deadlines within 48 hours.

## Workflow 3: Escalation Management

**Technical escalation path:**

| Level | Role | SEV-1 Trigger | SEV-2 Trigger |
|-------|------|---------------|---------------|
| L1 | On-call engineer | Immediate | 15 min |
| L2 | Senior engineer / Team lead | 30 min | 1 hour |
| L3 | Engineering Manager / Staff | 45 min | 2 hours |
| L4 | Director / CTO | 1 hour | 4 hours |

**Business escalation:**

| Severity | Duration | Escalate To |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| SEV-1 | Immediate | VP Engineering |
| SEV-1 | 30 min | CTO + Customer Success VP |
| SEV-1 | 1 hour | CEO + Full Executive Team |
| SEV-2 | 2 hours | VP Engineering |
| SEV-2 | 4 hours | CTO |

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Individual blame in postmortems** -- focus on system failures. "Why did the process allow this?" not "Why did Alice do this?"
2. **Skipping PIR for SEV-2** -- every SEV-1 and SEV-2 gets a postmortem within 3 business days.
3. **Action items without owners** -- every item needs a specific person and deadline.
4. **Deploying fixes under pressure without validation** -- validate fixes before declaring resolution; plan for secondary failures.
5. **Communication gaps** -- provide updates even when there is no new information.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Classifier assigns SEV1 to minor issues | Description keywords trigger high severity without impact data | Provide `affected_users` percentage and `business_impact` fields |
| Timeline shows "No valid events found" | Timestamps in unsupported format or missing `timestamp` key | Use ISO-8601, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, or Unix epoch |
| PIR produces shallow 5 Whys | Incident data lacks detail | Enrich input with `affected_services`, `customer_impact`; supply timeline via `--timeline` |
| Postmortem marks all action items invalid | Missing required fields | Each action item needs `title`, `owner`, `priority`, `deadline` |
| Severity score seems too low | Flat description without structured impact data | Provide full schema with `impact`, `signals`, `context` keys |
